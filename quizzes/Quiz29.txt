a. Took(sID, name, courseNum, title, year, grade)
b. Course(courseNum, title, year), Took(sID, courseNum, grade)
c. Student(sID, name), Course(courseNum, title),
   Took(sID, courseNum, year, grade)
d. Student(sID, name), Course(courseNum, title),
   Took(name, title, year, grade)

c.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. Consider the relation Took(sID, name, courseNum, title). Students
   have a unique student ID and (possibly not unique) name; courses have a
   unique course number and (possibly not unique) title. Each tuple in the
   relation encodes the fact that the given student took the given course.
   What are all of the functional dependencies for relation Took?
   (2 pts)

a. sID -> courseNum
b. sID -> name, courseNum -> title
c. name -> sID, title -> courseNum
d. courseNum -> sID
